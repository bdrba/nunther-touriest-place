Nepal is one of the most beautiful countries on earth, and it is truly a piece of heaven on Earth. Nepal is a country that has been overabundantly blessed by nature in every aspect. Everything about this place is mesmerizing. The landmarks from Himalayas to Hills to the plain terrain Terrai, each of them have their own beauty and each of them have comprised to make a single unit that is our beautiful country Nepal. Talking about the terai region, it gives the eye pleasing view of plain area and a lot of diversities in culture and traditions. The Rautahat district in Province 2 encompasses the Terai nation’s heart, soul, and personality. To obtain a Rautahat experience, you don’t have to travel far beyond Chandranigahapur, the district headquarters. Nunthar, for example, is a tiny village 16 kilometers north-east of Chandranigahapur with significant religious importance for the people.A traveler’s aim when visiting Nepal is to observe towering mountains, interwoven hills, and rivers moving from high terrain to the southern plains, gradually losing their intensity in graceful meanders. The majority of them make a stop there on their way out of the nation.They begin their journey south, though, and they are able to witness another side of Nepal: the Tarai, which is rich in huge landmasses, forests, meadows, and lowlands populated by indigenous people of various cultural origins.</p>
